/*
The problem is to write a program that will grade multiple-choice tests. Assume there are eight students and ten questions, and the answers are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records a student’s answers to the questions, as shown in the following array.
Students’ Answers to the Questions:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Student 0 A B A C C D E E A D
Student 1 D B A B C A E E A D
Student 2 E D D A C B E E A D
Student 3 C B A E D C E E A D
Student 4 A B D C C D E E A D
Student 5 B B E C C D E E A D
Student 6 B B A C C D E E A D
Student 7 E B E C C D E E A D
The key is stored in a one-dimensional array:
Key to the Questions:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Key D B D C C D A E A D
Your program grades the test and displays the result. It compares each student’s answers with the key, counts the number of correct answers, and displays it.
